excerpt: '
The present study took a differentiated perspective on parental psychological control to examine its impact on adolescent adjustment among 642 urban and rural Chinese adolescents (Mage = 12.14 years). Four times over the first two years of Junior High school, adolescents reported on parental psychological control, their psychological well-being (life satisfaction and depressive symptoms), and academic relative autonomy. Adolescents’ grades also were obtained. The findings show generally negative effects of social comparison shame, love withdrawal and harsh psychological control (but not shared shame or parental relationship-oriented guilt induction) on adolescents’ psychological well-being, and varied associations between different types of psychological control and adolescents’ academic functioning, with both similarities and differences between the urban and rural settings in the observed effects.'
