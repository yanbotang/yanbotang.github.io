Hello and welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and an affiliate of the Vector Institute under the joint supervision of Nancy Reid and Daniel Roy.
My main interest lies in higher order asymptotics and inference in the presence of a high number of nuisance parameters. 
I am also interested in inference problems in statistical genetics, and I primarily work with Radu Craiu and Lei Sun at the University of Toronto on such problems. 
This website contains a list of my publications, talks and CV. 

If you are interested in contacting me, my email is yanbo@utstat.toronto.edu .
