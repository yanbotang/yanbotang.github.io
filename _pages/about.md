Hello and welcome! I am a Chapman Fellow at Imperial College London (2022 -2023) and then Lecturer (roughly assistant professor) from 2023 onwards. I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2022 under the joint supervision of Nancy Reid and Daniel Roy.
My main interest lies in higher order asymptotics and inference in the presence of a high number of nuisance parameters. 
I am also interested in inference problems in statistical genetics and astrostatistics. 
This website contains a list of my publications, talks and CV. 

If you are interested in contacting me, my email is yanbo.tang[at]imperial.ac.uk .
