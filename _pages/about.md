Hello and welcome! I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the statistics section at Imperial College London. I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2022 under the joint supervision of Nancy Reid and Daniel Roy.
My main interests lie in statistical inference in the presence of a high number of nuisance parameters, and computational statistics.
I am also interested in inference problems in statistical genetics and astrostatistics. 
This website contains a list of my publications, talks and CV. 

If you are interested in contacting me, my email is yanbo.tang[at]imperial.ac.uk. 

<b> Supervision <b>

I can supervise PhD students through the Mathematics Research Doctoral Programme, or through the EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial and Oxford (StatML). 
The projects I offer are suitable for candidates with an interest in high-dimensional statistics or computational statistics and a good background in mathematical statistics. 
If you are interested in a PhD position under my supervision, please contact me via email before submitting an application; please attach a copy of your CV and transcript to your email.
