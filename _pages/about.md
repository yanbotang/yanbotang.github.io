Personal page of Yanbo Tang
======

Hello and welcome! I am a PhD candiadate at the University of Toronto under the joint supervision of Nancy Reid and Daniel Roy. My main interest lies in higher order asymptotics and inference in the presence of a high number of nuissance paramters. I am also interested in inference problems in statsitical genetics, and I work with Radu Criau and Lei Sun at the university of Toronto on such problems. This website contains a list of my publications, talks and CV. 

If you are interested in contacting me, my email is right under my profile photo.
